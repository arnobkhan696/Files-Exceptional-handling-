        "Theoretical Question:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
        "  - interpreted languages execute code line by line, while compiled languages translate the entire code into machine code before execution.\n",
        "2. What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        "  - In Python, exception handling is the process of managing errors that occur while a program is running.\n",
        "3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        "  - The finally block in exception handling executes code that needs to run regardless of whether an exception occurs. This is useful for closing resources, such as files or database connections, and preventing resource leaks.\n",
        "4. What is logging in Python?\n",
        "  - In Python, logging is a built-in module that allows developers to track events, debug issues, and monitor the health of their applications by systematically recording events, such as errors, warnings, and informational messages, during program execution.\n",
        "5. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "  - In Python, the __del__ method, also known as a destructor or finalizer, is called when an object is about to be garbage collected, allowing for cleanup of resources before the object is destroyed.\n",
        "6. What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n",
        "  - import imports an entire code library. from import imports a specific member or members of the library.\n",
        "7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n",
        "  - In Python, exception handling is done using the try and except blocks. When a program encounters an error during execution, it raises an exception. To prevent the program from crashing, you can catch and handle these exceptions using structured exception handling.\n",
        "8. What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n",
        "  - ensures that a file is automatically closed after its operations are complete, even if errors occur, simplifying resource management and making code cleaner and more robust.\n",
        "9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
        "  - Multithreading uses multiple threads within a single process, sharing memory and resources.\n",
        "   While multiprocessing uses multiple processes, each with its own memory space.\n",
        "10. What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n",
        "   - Logging in programming offers several advantages, primarily aiding in debugging, performance analysis, and monitoring by providing a record of a program's activities, including errors, warnings, and events.\n",
        "11. What is memory management in Python?\n",
        "   - handled automatically by the interpreter using a private heap, reference counting, and a garbage collector.\n",
        "12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n",
        "   - In Python, exception handling involves using try, except, else, and finally.\n",
        "13. Why is memory management important in Python?\n",
        "   - because it directly impacts program performance, resource usage, and stability, especially for large-scale applications, and is handled automatically by the Python interpreter, allowing developers to focus on code logic rather than memory allocation.\n",
        "14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
        "   - In exception handling, the try block contains code that might raise an error, and the except block handles those errors (exceptions) gracefully, preventing the program from crashing and allowing it to continue execution.\n",
        "15. How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
        "   - Python's garbage collection system automatically manages memory by reclaiming memory occupied by objects that are no longer referenced, primarily using reference counting and a cyclic garbage collector to handle circular references.\n",
        "16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
        "   - In exception handling, the else block is used to define a section of code that should be executed only if no exception occurs in the try block. It helps in organizing the code more clearly by separating the error-prone code (inside the try block) from the normal execution code (inside the else block).\n",
        "17. What are the common logging levels in Python?\n",
        "   - In Python, the logging module provides a flexible framework for emitting log messages from programs. Logging levels are used to indicate the severity or importance of the events being logged.\n",
        "18. What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?\n",
        "   - Both os.fork() and the multiprocessing module are used to create new processes in Python, but they differ in terms of usage, portability, and abstraction.\n",
        "   1. os.fork()\n",
        "  - i) A low-level system call used to create a child process.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - ii) It creates a copy of the current process.\n",
        "\n",
        "  2. multiprocessing module\n",
        "  - i) A high-level module for creating and managing processes.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - ii) Provides an interface similar to the threading module.\n",
        "19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n",
        "   - Closing files in Python is an essential practice that helps maintain data integrity, prevent resource leaks, and ensure the reliability of your applications.\n",
        "20. What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?\n",
        "   - In Python, read() reads the entire file content as a single string, while readline() reads a single line from the file at a time, returning it as a string.\n",
        "21. What is the logging module in Python used for?\n",
        "   - The Python logging module is used to track events, debug issues, and monitor the health of Python applications by capturing and storing information about program execution.\n",
        "22. What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?\n",
        "   - Python has a built-in os module with methods for interacting with the operating system, like creating files and directories, management of files and directories, input, output, environment variables, process management, etc.\n",
        "23. What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?\n",
        "   - Python's automatic memory management, while simplifying development, presents challenges like potential memory leaks due to circular references, performance overhead from garbage collection, and difficulty in optimizing memory usage for specific applications.\n",
        "24. How do you raise an exception manually in Python?\n",
        "   - To manually raise an exception in Python, you can use the raise keyword.\n",
        "25. Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?\n",
        "   - Multithreading is crucial for certain applications as it enables concurrent execution of tasks, leading to improved performance, resource utilization, and responsiveness.\n"
